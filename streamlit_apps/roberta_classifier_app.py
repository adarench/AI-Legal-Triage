    1. **Retrained with Better Parameters**
       - Increased training epochs from 3 to 5
       - Reduced learning rate from 2e-5 to 1e-5
       - Added data augmentation for underrepresented classes
    
    2. **Post-Processing Rules**
       - Added rules to fix common misclassifications
       - Implemented for the most problematic categories
       - Uses text patterns to identify mis-labeled clauses
    
    3. **Confidence Thresholding**
       - Added uncertainty handling for low-confidence predictions
       - Marks uncertain predictions for human review
       - Preserves original prediction for reference
